# Portfolio_Data_Scientist
This portfolio showcases data science projects I've developed, from raw data to analysis and conclusions. Each project covers essential steps, like data preparation, modeling, and result interpretation. I plan to keep expanding this portfolio over time to reflect my continuous learning and growth in data science.
